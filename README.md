# Local Project Manager

A Python TUI (Text User Interface) application for discovering, organizing, and managing local project directories.

## Status

⚠️ **In Development** - This project is in early planning stages. No implementation code exists yet.

## What It Does

Local Project Manager scans your filesystem to help you:

- **Discover projects** by finding README files (.md, .txt) across directory trees
- **Identify undocumented projects** that lack README files
- **View and edit** existing README files in a scrolling pane
- **Create READMEs** for undocumented projects
- **Prune unwanted projects** you no longer need

## Planned Features

- Recursive directory scanning (configurable root directory)
- Smart filtering with configurable ignore lists (node_modules, etc.)
- Subproject exclusion to avoid duplicate listings
- Interactive TUI built with Textual
- README viewing, editing, creation, and deletion
